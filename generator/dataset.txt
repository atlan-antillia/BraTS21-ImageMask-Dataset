Dataset Citation

The dataset used here has been taken from Task1 (Segmentation) dataset of the following website.

RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2021

http://braintumorsegmentation.org/

The RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 challenge utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative baseline 
multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, and focuses on the evaluation of 
state-of-the-art methods for (Task 1) the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous brain 
glioblastoma sub-regions in mpMRI scans. 
Furthemore, this BraTS 2021 challenge also focuses on the evaluation of (Task 2) classification 
methods to predict the MGMT promoter methylation status.
